# Census Custom API Connections

Census provides fast and reliable data synchronization from your data warehouse
to dozens of SaaS applications, via our SaaS connector library. Although we are
adding connectors as quickly as we can, we realize that there may be some
destinations that we will never support - bespoke or internal systems, niche
SaaS applications, or applications with private APIs.

Custom APIs allow you to "bring your own" SaaS connector to Census for use in
these types of integrations. In order to write a connector, you'll need to
implement a few simple APIs that teach Census about the type of data your
connector can process, the operations allowed on that data, and how to actually
load that data. You'll deploy this code to a URL on the internet that Census can
reach, then configure Census to discover your connector using that URL.

Custom APIs cannot be shared across Census accounts, and there is currently no
plan for community-owned connectors or a connector marketplace. There are a
number of core Census features that are not currently available to Custom APIs,
and the Census product team is committed to building high-quality first-party
connectors for as many SaaS applications as we can. Please contact us if Census
is missing a SaaS connector that you believe would be useful to our customer
community!

This guide documents the protocol that your Custom API will use to communicate
with Census, and provides tips on connector design, debugging, and
troubleshooting.

Custom APIs are a beta feature in Census. Please contact your account
representative if you'd like access to this feature and we'll get you set up!

## Getting Started

### What You'll Need

* A Census account that's enrolled in the Custom API beta (contact your sales
  rep to get access)
* A place to run your Custom API code. Custom APIs have to be accessible via a
  public endpoint over HTTPS, so if you're testing your code on a development
  machine, we recommend you use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) or a similar tool to
  expose your local endpoint to a temporary public URL
* A destination to which you want to integrate. Generally speaking your Custom
  API will act as a proxy that passes data from Census to some destination SaaS
  system, though the destination can be any data store.
* A plan for testing you connection. You can use a Census model to "hard code" a
  small data set in your warehouse as a source for testing. You should initially
  point your API to a non-production destination while you test syncs to ensure
  you don't alter or overwrite any critical data. Once you have verified the
  correctness of your Custom API, you can start using it to sync production data
* The sample code contained in this repository can be a useful starting point
  for a Javascript or TypeScript integration - it takes care of the JSON-RPC
  protocol and provides stub implementations of some methods for simple Custom
  APIs.

### How It Works

Your Custom API is a bridge between Census and your destination SaaS or other
system. Census syncs are dividied into two phases, each of which will call
different methods on your API: planning and execution.

![Planning Diagram](assets/plan.png)

In the planning phase, Census will ask your API what kinds of data it manages
and what operations are available on that data. This phase is broken into three
API methods:
* `list_objects` - Get a list of the objects your API can write to.
* `list_fields` - Get a list of the fields, along with data types and validation
  rules, for a given object.
* `supported_operations` - Find out what kinds of "writes" can be performed on
  an object - can new instances be created? Can existing instances be modified?

![Execution Diagram](assets/execute.png)

Once the sync has been planned by the user (utilizing metadata from your API and
your data warehouse) it can be executed. At execution time, Census will call two
methods on your API:
* `get_sync_speed` - For a given sync plan, how quickly should Census send data
  to your API?
* `sync_batch` - Sync one batch of records to your destination, reporting
  success and failure for each record.

### Objects and Fields

Every Census connector has a schema, which is made up of *Objects* and *Fields*.
Objects are roughly analogous to tables in a database, whereas fields are like
columns. Your Custom API connector will tell Census what its schema is as part
of the planning process (via the `list_objects` and `list_fields` methods).
Census will use this information to populate its mapping API, and guide the
users of your Custom API to map tables and columns in their data warehouse to
your destination.

Every SaaS application has a different data surface it exposes to the world, and
there is some art in deciding how to model SaaS data APIs as objects and fields.
This also depends on the operations the SaaS application gives you (see below). 

Many SaaS applications / destinations do not provide APIs to discover objects
and fields. In this case, your Custom API should return a hard-coded list of
objects and fields and return those to Census.

### Operations

Destination systems may also have rules about what can be done with new and
existing data. Census currently allows Custom APIs to choose from three
operations for each object:
* `upsert` (most common) - records in the destination can be created or modified
* `insert` - records can only be created in the destination, they cannot be modified
* `update` - records can only be modified in the destination, they cannot be created

Census does not know whether a record already exists in your destination when
using a Custom API, so it is up to you to enforce the semantics of the
operation(s) you have chosen to support. For example, if Census has been
configured to `update` records in the destination but not `insert` them, your
Custom API must first check the destination to see if a matching record exists,
and tell Census to skip it if it does not exist. Some destination systems may
provide APIs like this for you (create this record only if it does not exist) if
they have strong enforcement of uniqueness on identifiers.

### Matching Source and Destination Data

Every sync plan created by Census for an `insert`, `update`, or `upsert` sync
will include a field that should be used as the identifier for matching source
and destination records. This field must be a unique and required in both
systems (the source data warehouse and the destination SaaS), and it will be
provided for every record. Your Custom API will tell Census (via the
`list_fields` method) which fields can be legally used as identifiers.

### Security Considerations

The requests that Census makes to your Custom API may include sensitive data
about your business or customers, and your API must protect that data. In
addition, your API must protect any secrets or credentials that it will use to
authenticate to the ultimate destination system.

All connections from Census to a Custom API must use HTTPS with a certificate
signed by a well-known CA - self-signed certificates are prohibited.

Your Custom API URL can include a cryptographically unguessable segment that you
can use to verify calls are coming from Census and not an imposter. For example,
if your Custom API is hosted at https://census-custom-api.yourcompany.example,
you could configure Census to invoke it as
https://census-custom-api.yourcompany.example?census_authentication=XoBcsUoFT82wgAcA and
verify all calls include the correct `census_authentication` value.

Secrets needed by your Custom API can be stored in several places:
* In environmental variables accessible to your Custom API - this is a common
  pattern supported by many API hosting platforms.
* In your application's source code - this is usually a bad practice because
  source code may not be stored as securely as environmental variables, but this
  depends on your organization's practices
* As query string or path segment parameters in your Custom API's URL. To
  continue the example above, if your Custom API needs an API key to access the
  destination system, you could include it as a second parameter:
  https://census-custom-api.yourcompany.example?census_authentication=XoBcsUoFT82wgAcA&api_key=Ur2NtbfiPuFSkdQp

Because your Custom API URL can contain secrets, it is considered to be
sensitive data by Census and encrypted within our logs and databases.

## Writing Your Custom API

### Sending and Receiving JSON-RPC messages

All communications between Census and your Custom API are JSON-RPC method
invocations. JSON-RPC is a simple protocol for request-reply conversations
between a client (Census) and a server (your Custom API). While there are
several libraries that can help you implement JSON-RPC, you may find it simpler
to "roll your own".

Census follows the [JSON-RPC 2.0
specification](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) with a few additional
restrictions to simplify things even more:
* `params` (in the request) and `result` (in the response) will always be JSON
  objects, not arrays.
* `params` will never be omitted - if a method has no params, an empty object
  (`{}`) will be sent as the value for `params`.
* JSON-RPC notifications (requests without an `id` that do not require a
  response) are not used in this protocol.
* JSON-RPC batching is not used - all HTTP sessions will contain exactly one
  request. Census will attempt to use HTTP Keep-Alive to reuse the connection
  for subsequent requests, but support for Keep-Alive is optional.
  
The JSON-RPC specification does not specify a transport layer. Census uses HTTPS
as the transport layer, with all messages sent as the body of an HTTP POST to a
single URL that your custom connector defines. The `Content-Type` of both the
HTTP request and response must be `application/json`.

Here's an example of a valid invocation of the `test_connection` method,
assuming your Custom API is located at https://example.com/census

#### HTTP Request

```http
POST /census HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: Census https://www.getcensus.com
Content-Type: application/json
Accept-Encoding: gzip;q=1.0,deflate;q=0.6,identity;q=0.3
Accept: */*
Connection: keep-alive
Keep-Alive: 30
Host: example.com
Content-Length: 96

{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"test_connection","params":{},"id":"d33ded2672b7877ff833c317892d748c"}
```

#### HTTP Response

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
X-Powered-By: Express
content-length: 83
content-type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Date: Fri, 19 Mar 2021 00:25:21 GMT
Connection: keep-alive

{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"d33ded2672b7877ff833c317892d748c","result":{"success":true}}
```

Every request currently requires a synchronous response. Census will time out
requests that take a long time to complete; if your connector is unable to
complete its work (particularly the `sync_data` method) within this time, you
can use the `get_sync_speed` method to tell Census to send data more slowly
until you are able to complete within this timeout.

### Versioning

During the beta phase this API is unversioned. Backwards-incompatible changes
may occur; Census will attempt to notify impacted customers before making those
changes.

### Caching, State, and Parallel Invocations

The Custom API protocol is designed to allow you to implement your API in a
completely stateless manner. Specifically:

* Don't cache data or metadata. Census will perform caching of your objects,
  fields, supported operations, etc. automatically, with policies to refresh
  stale data and controls for users to force invalidation. Adding additional
  caching may make your Custom API behave unusually in the Census UI.
* Don't store any other durable state, especially service data, unless your
  Custom API is "part of" the destination system. Try to ensure that calls to
  `sync_batch` result in the data being actually persisted to the destination
  system - once you tell Census a record has been synced, Census may never send
  that record again (if it doesn't change in the source) and Census has know way
  to know that it was "lost" from the destination system
* Expect Census to send multiple requests to your Custom API in parallel. For
  performance, Census will retrieve / update schemas in parallel, and will sync
  data in parallel. You can control the degree of parallelism for syncs via the
  `get_sync_speed` method.

### Error Handling

Census will take care of most error handling on your behalf. Census uses a
hierarchical retry strategy - single records or batches may be retried on
failure, and full syncs may be retried if Census detects that a sync was
incomplete. In addition, Census can automatically perform "full syncs" of the
source data set if it detects certain conditions that can lead to loss of
durability.

Do not be surprised if Census tries to sync the same record to your destination
multiple times - this is a normal part of our recovery-oriented sync runner.

Census provides three "channels" for your Custom API to return errors:
* If you Custom API fails to return a well-formed JSON-RPC payload, Census will
  fail with an "unknown error". If you have enabled the Custom API debugger (see
  below), the error will be captured for later troubleshooting
* Your Custom API may return a structured error message and code in the error
  property of the JSON-RPC response object. This error code and message will be
  displayed in the Census UI.
* Two methods, `test_connection` and `sync_batch`, provide the ability to return
  application-level error messages. For `test_connection`, you can return a
  high-level error messsage helping the user debug why your Custom API may not
  be working. `sync_batch` requires your Custom API to indicate a success or
  failure status for each record in the batch - error messages associated with
  record-level failures will be displayed in the Census Sync History UI

And finally, do not hesitate to fail any method calls if your Custom API
encounters an unexpected error - the sync engine is designed to be safe even in
the presences of transient or permanent failures. It's always safer and simpler
to fail and propogate errors back to Census than to attempt your own retry logic.

### RPC Details

Your connector must implement all of these methods to work with Census:

#### test_connection : Verify that the custom connection is working

Census calls this method when a user presses the “Test Connection” button on
your custom connection. When this is invoked, you should do something to test
that the connection to your upstream SaaS application is working correctly -
specifically, it’s useful to verify API keys.

##### Request

This method has no parameters - the request parameters will always be an empty JSON object

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "test_connection",
  "id": "d33ded2672b7877ff833c317892d748c",
  "params": {}
}
```

##### Response

This method has two possible responses. On success, you should respond with:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "d33ded2672b7877ff833c317892d748c",
  "result": {
    "success": true
  }
}
```

If an error occurs performing the connection test, respond with:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "d33ded2672b7877ff833c317892d748c",
  "result": {
    "success": false,
    "error_message": "The API Key is invalid"
  }
}
```

#### list_objects : List all the objects supported by the custom connection

Census calls this method periodically (in response to UI interaction as well as
proactively in the background to warm its caches) to get the list of objects
your connector supports as sync destinations. Your connector will be useless
unless you respond with at least one object.

Objects have both labels (for humans) and API names. These may be the same
value, but they do not have to be. The API name is an identifier chosen by you
that acts as the primary key for an object; an object’s label may change over
time, but its API name must not. You should choose API names that correspond
with long-lived identifiers in your destination SaaS.

##### Request

This method has no parameters - the request will always be an empty JSON object

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "list_objects",
  "id": "6d2bd06835a565bee3e2250177f1d738",
  "params": {}
}
```

##### Response

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "list_objects",
  "id": "6d2bd06835a565bee3e2250177f1d738",
  "result": {
    "objects": [
      {
        "object_api_name": "restaurant",
        "label": "Restaurants"
      },
      {
        "object_api_name": "venue", 
        "label": "Concert Venues"
      },
    ]
  }
}
```

#### list_fields : List all the fields for a given object

Census calls this method periodically to get the list of fields for a supported
object. An object must have at least one field with `identifer` set to `true`,
or it cannot be the destination of a Census sync.

A field’s description consists of these required properties:

- `field_api_name` (string): A unique, unchanging identifier for this field
- `label` (string): A human-friendly name for the field
- `identifer` (boolean): If true, this field can act as a shared identifier in a
  Census sync. In order to be used an an identifier, a field must fulfill a few
  constraints:
  - It must be unique
  - It must be required
  - It should be easy to create or update records in the destination SaaS by this value
- `required` (boolean): If true, a record cannot be created unless a values is
  specified for this field. Census will enforce this by requiring a mapping from
  a data warehouse column to this field before a sync can be performed.
- `createable` (boolean): If true, this field can be populated on record
  creation in the destination SaaS. This will be true for most fields. An
  example of a non-creatable field would be something like an auto-populated
  “Created At” timestamp that you’re not able to write to using the SaaS API.
- `updateable` (boolean): Similar to `createable` - if true, this field can be
  populated when updating an existing record. Generally speaking, if a field is
  neither `createable` nor `updateable`, you might consider omitting it entirely
  from the `list_fields` response, as it won’t be usable by Census for any
  syncs.
- `type` (string): The data type for this field. Census uses this to plan any
  “type casts” required to translate data from your data warehouse to your SaaS,
  to warn of invalid or lossy type casts, and will format the data on the wire
  to your custom connector using this type information. If `identifier` is
  `true`, the type must be `string` or `integer`. See the table below for the
  full list of types.
- `array` (boolean): If true, this field accepts an array of values instead of a
  single value. Any type can be used as an `array` type, but `array` types
  cannot be `identifier`s. Census will require array fields to have a matching
  array field in the mapped data warehouse column.

| Census Type | Can Be Identifier | JSON Wire Type | JSON Wire Example        | Notes                                                                                                                         |

#### supported_operations : List the operations that can be performed on an object

Census calls this method when a user is setting up a sync to your custom
connector to determine how data should be copied to your object. You should
advertise all the operations you are capable of supporting - the Census user
will pick one of them from your supported list when they are configuring their
sync. Currently, custom connectors support these operations:

- `upsert`: Look for a matching record in the SaaS - if it is present, update
  its fields with the new values, if not, create it. This is the most commonly
  used operation.
- `insert`: If a matching record is not present in the SaaS, create it. If it is
  present, skip syncing this record.
- `update`: If a matching record is present in the SaaS, update it with new
  field values. If it is not present, do not create it and skip syncing it.

    "operations": ["upsert", "update"],
  }
}
```

#### get_sync_speed : Tell Census what batch sizes and sync speeds should be used

Census will call this method just before a sync is starting to determine how
much and how quickly it should send data to your custom connector. In order to
make your connector as easy to implement as possible, Census allows you to
configure the batch sizes, maximum throughput, and maximum parallelism it should
use when sending you data.

Your response should include these three values:

- `maximum_batch_size`: How many records Census should include in each call to
  `sync_batch` (see below). Census may give your service smaller batches than
  this, but it will never send larger batches. If your SaaS API has a batch API,
  you should strongly consider setting this value to match you SaaS’s maximum
  batch size. If your SaaS does not have a batch import API, we recommend
  setting this to a relatively low value (under 100) then testing the
  performance of your custom connector with different batch sizes.
- `maximum_parallel_batches`: How many simultaneous invocations of `sync_batch`
  Census will perform. It’s generally safe to set this to a large number and
  control your sync speed using the other two variables, but if your underlying
  infrastructure (web server or function-as-a-service provider) limits the
  number of parallel calls to your function, you can use this parameter to stay
  under that limit and avoid queueing at the network layer.
- `maximum_records_per_second`: How many records (not batches) Census will send
  to you custom connector per second, across all parallel batches. This should
  be matched to your SaaS API’s maximum records per secord, possibly with some
  buffer to allow for measurement error. The actual records per second may be
  limited by the batch size, number of parallel batches, and the average time it
  takes for your connector to complete one batch, but Census will attempt to
  never exceed this number.

Known Issue: Currently these “speed limits” are enforced at the sync level, not
across the entire connector, so two simultaneous syncs to different objects on
the same connector may cause these limits to be exceeded.

#### sync_batch : Load one batch of data from Census to your destination application

This is the actual “data transfer” method in the API - once configuration is
performed and a sync plan is made, Census will call this method repeatedly with
batches of data from your warehouse that are ready to load.

This API should attempt to load all of the records in the batch, and must return
a success or failure message to Census for each attempted record. It is
extremely important that you only tell Census that a record succeeded if you are
certain of it - once Census records that a record has been successfully synced,
that record may never be copied again (if it never changes). Census assumes that
all records that are not explicitly reported as successes have failed, and
should be retried, but providing an explicit failure message can be helpful to
the users of your custom connector so they can fix any data issues.

Census employs a hierarchical retry strategy - syncs are retried at the record
level, at the batch level, and at the sync level, so if you are unsure if a
record or batch has succeeded, we encourage you to fail fast and rely on Census
to retry as the best way to avoid data integrity issues.

## Debugging Your Custom API

Census provides a "debugger" for all Custom API connections that shows a full
log of all requests and responses to the connection and any errors encoutered
during processing. The debugger is disabled by default. To enable it, click the
"Debug" button on your Custom API in the Connections view and then click the
record button.

Census will record as many as 100 requests to your API. You can replay specific
requests repeatedly in order to test fixes. Recorded requests are encrypted by
Census, but we still advise you to use the debugger to clear out any potentially
sensitive requests once your troubleshooting has completed.
